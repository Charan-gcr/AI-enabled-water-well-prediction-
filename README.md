Inspiration

The inspiration behind the AI-Enabled Water Well Prediction System is to address the critical issue of water scarcity in rural villages, towns, and cities.

Access to clean and reliable groundwater sources is essential for agriculture, drinking water supply, and industrial activities.
Traditional methods of well construction often lack precision, leading to inefficient resource utilization.

This project seeks to leverage AI and machine learning to optimize well construction, ensuring sustainable water access for communities.

What it does

The AI-Enabled Water Well Prediction System is a comprehensive platform that combines data integration, machine learning models, and user-friendly interfaces to facilitate informed decision-making in well construction.

It predicts key parameters such as well suitability, depth, discharge, drilling techniques, and groundwater quality based on geological and hydrological data.

The system aims to maximize the success rate of well construction while minimizing resource wastage and environmental impact.

How we built it

Data Collection and Integration: Diverse groundwater-related data, including lithology, geophysical logs, water levels, water quality, and aquifer maps, were collected and preprocessed into a unified format for analysis.

AI Model Development: Machine learning models, including Random Forest, were trained to predict well-related parameters. Fine-tuning and model improvement were achieved through continuous learning from new data and user feedback.

User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive web-based interface with map-based location selection was developed. AI model predictions are presented in a user-friendly manner, providing valuable insights for well construction decisions.

Feedback Loop and User Engagement: A structured feedback mechanism was implemented to collect user input on system predictions and usability, enabling continuous improvement.

Data Privacy and Security: Robust data privacy and security measures were implemented to protect user information and maintain data integrity.
